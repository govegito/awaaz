                    Speech impaired children are often neglected children in one sense or another. Because they are speech impaired, they have difficulty getting admissions to schools even if the education in government schools is free; this is because sometimes some cases of speech-impaired children are not able to follow and understand the teachers and are therefore, not in a position to keep up with studies.

                    Our effort is to give them a safe, friendly, and happy environment. Lots of sunshine. A hot meal. Special nourishment such as milk and fruits. Crafts and games to relax and develop the mind and body. And dedicated studies.

                    As some cases of speech impairment often suffers from mental retardness and such cases need special care and cannot go to regular schools and thus we provide them such education where they are taught according to learning pattern.

                    for some mild cases of speech impairment we can improve upon their speech by providing them speech therapy sessions in schools.
                    
                    The main goal of speech therapy is to improve communication. Some of the goals of speech therapy might include: Improving communication between the brain and the body through visual and auditory aids such as mirrors and tape recorders. Improving fluency through breathing exercises.

                    some cases of speech impairment are often curable with minor/major surgeries or any other treatment. We provide adequate education on how those impairment are cured and the provide the best doctors and any other help whether it be financial or any other.

                    some cases need proper care and nourishment, so our volunteer teach parents how to take proper care ,like oral exercises , breathing exercises, etc. 

                    we also teach them how to use assistive technologies for further improvement and for some people with our app Talkitt which would help them communicating with much ease.
