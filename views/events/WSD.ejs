  <h3>OUTREACH AND IDENTIFICATION</h3>
  <p>This year, the Awaaz Foundation is focusing on reaching out and identifying new members of the vocal disorders
     community. For many years, the Awaaz has supported outreach projects in different countries and conducted educational
      events for both lay and health care professionals in conjunction with our national member organizations (NMOs).

    The Awaaz2020 campaign will feature examples of Awaaz outreach initiatives such as organizing regional workshops,
     raising awareness of speaking through media coverage or training health professionals and collecting data.
     It will combine these examples with submissions from our community about outreach efforts in their own regions or 
     ideas about what would be helpful for future initiatives.<br><hr>
    
    This landmark day also helps to illustrate the importance of the Awaaz Treatment program- an important endeavour for
     the Awaaz that provides
     a range of integrated care development training programs to ensure the local infrastructure and medical expertise are
      available to optimize and appropriately use donated products.<br>
    
    Stay tuned as we take together the first step to care!
